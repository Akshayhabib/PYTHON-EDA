## What is Coronavirus Pandemic?

The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread worldwide.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 20 April 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 506 million cases and 6.2 million deaths across the whole world, making it one of the deadliest in history.


- In this project I am using three different datasets  and perform data analysis using python and tableau

- In this project I will make different plots using tableau and then make a dashboard from the visuals
